# AudioBloom

AudioBloom is a next-generation audio visualizer designed specifically for Apple Silicon M3 Pro, leveraging its neural engine and advanced graphics capabilities to create stunning, immersive visualizations.

## About

AudioBloom reimagines the classic ProjectM/MilkDrop visualizer concepts with modern Apple technologies. It uses Metal for rendering, the Neural Engine for advanced pattern recognition, and a Swift/SwiftUI architecture for a seamless macOS experience.

## Requirements

- macOS 15+
- Apple Silicon M3 Pro (or better) Mac
- Xcode 16.3+

## Features

- Metal-based rendering pipeline for fluid, high-performance visuals
- Neural Engine integration for intelligent pattern recognition
- Real-time audio analysis and visualization
- Modern SwiftUI interface
- Optimized specifically for Apple Silicon

## Development Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in Xcode 16.3 or later
3. Build and run on a compatible macOS 15+ system

## Architecture

AudioBloom is structured into three primary modules:

- **CoreAudio**: Handles audio capture and processing
- **Visualizer**: Manages Metal rendering and visual effects
- **ML**: Integrates with the Neural Engine for advanced pattern recognition
