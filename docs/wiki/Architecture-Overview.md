# Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

AudioBloomAI follows a modular architecture designed for performance, extensibility, and maintainability. The application is built on Swift 6 and targets macOS 15+.

### Core Components

#### 1. AudioBloomCore
The central module managing application state and coordination.

- **Key Components**:
  - `AudioBloomSettings`: Application configuration and persistence
  - `AudioDataPublisher`: Real-time data flow management
  - `VisualTheme`: Customizable visual appearance system

#### 2. AudioProcessor
Handles all audio processing operations using Metal acceleration.

- **Key Components**:
  - Audio Processing Pipeline
  - Feature Extraction System
  - Buffer Management
  - Error Recovery System

#### 3. Visualizer
Manages real-time visualization using Metal.

- **Key Components**:
  - Metal Shader Infrastructure
  - Visualization Renderer
  - Effect Controller
  - State Management

## Technical Specifications

### Performance Requirements
- Real-time audio processing
- Low-latency visualization
- Efficient resource management
- Smooth effect transitions

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Swift 6
- **Graphics**: Metal
- **Platform**: macOS 15+
- **Build System**: Swift Package Manager

### Data Flow
1. Audio Input → AudioProcessor
2. Feature Extraction → AudioDataPublisher
3. Data Processing → VisualizationController
4. Rendering → Screen Output

## Development Architecture

### Module Independence
Each module is designed to be independently testable and maintainable:

- Separate Swift packages
- Clear public APIs
- Minimal cross-module dependencies
- Comprehensive unit tests

### Extension Points
The architecture supports future extensions through:

- Plugin system (planned)
- Custom effect support
- Themeable interface
- Configurable processing pipeline

## Security Considerations

- Secure audio data handling
- Resource access management
- Error handling and recovery
- State persistence security

## Performance Optimization

- Metal acceleration
- Efficient memory management
- Optimized render pipeline
- Smart resource allocation

## Future Considerations

- Plugin architecture
- Additional visualization modes
- Enhanced audio processing features
- Cross-platform potential
