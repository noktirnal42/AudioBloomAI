## Google Search Console Setup

Google Search Console is a free tool that helps you monitor, maintain, and troubleshoot your site's presence in Google Search results.

### Creating a Google Search Console Account

1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Start now"

### Adding Your Property

For GitHub Pages sites, you'll use the URL prefix property type:

1. In the property selector, click "Add property"
2. Select "URL prefix"
3. Enter `https://noktirnal42.github.io/AudioBloomAI/`
4. Click "Continue"

## Site Verification Process

You must verify that you own the site before Google Search Console will provide data. For GitHub Pages, the HTML tag verification method is recommended.

### HTML Tag Verification

1. In Google Search Console, select the HTML tag verification method
2. Google will provide a meta tag that looks like:
   ```html
   <meta name="google-site-verification" content="YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE" />
   ```
3. Copy this tag

### Adding the Verification Tag to Your Site

1. Clone the repository locally (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:noktirnal42/AudioBloomAI.git
   cd AudioBloomAI
   git checkout gh-pages
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in a text editor
3. Locate the existing placeholder verification tag:
   ```html
   <!-- Google Search Console Verification (placeholder - replace with actual verification code) -->
   <meta name="google-site-verification" content="your-verification-code">
   ```
4. Replace it with the tag provided by Google Search Console
5. Commit and push the changes:
   ```bash
   git add index.html
   git commit -m "Add Google Search Console verification tag"
   git push origin gh-pages
   ```

6. Back in Google Search Console, click "Verify"
7. Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to update, then try verification again if needed

## Sitemap Submission

A sitemap helps search engines understand the structure of your site and find all pages.

### Submitting Your Sitemap

1. In Google Search Console, select your property
2. In the left sidebar, navigate to "Sitemaps"
3. Enter `sitemap.xml` in the "Add a new sitemap" field
4. Click "Submit"

Google will process your sitemap and report on any issues found. You've already created a sitemap.xml file with the following content:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
   <url>
      <loc>https://noktirnal42.github.io/AudioBloomAI/</loc>
      <lastmod>2025-04-10</lastmod>
      <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
      <priority>1.0</priority>
   </url>
</urlset>
```

This is correctly formatted for search engines to crawl.

## Monitoring and Maintenance
